# Password Reset Flow

### 1. Email Link → Callback Route (`/auth/callback`)
When the user clicks the reset link in their email, Supabase appends a `?code=` to the callback URL. The callback route:
- Exchanges that one-time code for a **recovery session** via `exchangeCodeForSession(code)`
- Redirects to `/auth/reset-password?verified=true`

If the code is invalid or already used, it redirects to login with an error.

### 2. Middleware (`proxy`)
Before the request even hits the page, middleware checks:
- `/auth/reset-password` is in `authOnlyRoutes`, so **unauthenticated users** (no session at all) get redirected to login immediately
- This blocks the "manually typed url" case

---

### 3. Reset Password Page
For users who **do** have a session, the page runs two checks:

**Check 1: `getUser()`**
Validates the session server-side against Supabase. If there's no valid user, redirect to login. This is the secure check — `getUser()` hits the Supabase server, it can't be spoofed with a tampered cookie.

**Check 2: AMR (Authentication Method Reference)**
`getSession()` returns the JWT access token. `decodeJwt()` cracks open the JWT payload and reads the `amr` array, which Supabase embeds to describe *how* the session was created. A recovery session has:
```json
[{ "method": "recovery", "timestamp": 1776302185 }]
```
A normal password login would have `{ "method": "password" }` instead. If `isRecovery` is false, the user gets redirected away — they can't access the form even with a valid normal session.

## Why Each Piece Is Necessary

| Scenario | Blocked By |
|---|---|
| No session, types bare URL | Middleware |
| Normal logged-in user types bare URL | AMR check on page |
| Uses expired/invalid reset link | Callback rejects bad code |
| Valid recovery session | Allowed through |
